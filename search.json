    "text": "Conclusion\nThe weather in Philadelphia on the days of my birthday for the past twenty years was something I was curious about, especially to see if there was a pattern that I can relate back to myself. I found that majority of my birthdays fell on a Monday, it did snow nor rain for most of the years, and the avgerage temperature was 32 degrees on my birthdays put together. So overall, most of my birthdays throughout the years here in Philadelphia were not extremely cold, but still on the chillier side. I find that interesting, because I spent my recent birthday in 2026 freezing, because of how cold it was from the piled up snow from the previous snow storm and high winds. I thought this was the norm weather here in Philadelphia on Jan 30, but referencing past years’ data it shows otherwise. This was an interesting finding."
