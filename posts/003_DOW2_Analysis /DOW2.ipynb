    "#### I have always heard the saying whether from my parents, friends, or from my own observations that some races are more outgoing than others. This is a topic heavily discussed in media and psychology as well, which is the fact that based on your race (more commonly dicussed in the cultural upbringing context) you are described to be more expressive and social. I have frequently heard about the the generalizations of Asians being more introverted than other Europeans, which to a certain extent, I always thought of as true. This is all very much an interesting topic that can ignite intense conversation at parties, but how truly is this accurate when analyzing real personality data? "

    "#### This question feels especially relevant to me given that it is something I also noticed in my life, where I assumed extroversion was linked to race. Many of my Asian friends are introverts, and my Caucasian friends all relatively extroverted. I wanted to delve more into this topic, especially because extroversion is often discussed in the media as being connected to cultural upbringing. I wanted to explore whether data could back this up. Based on self-reported levels of extroversion in different racial groups in the Open Psychometrics Big Five dataset, I sought to observe any noticeable patterns that could explain potential associations."

At first glance, Artic shows overall higher averages, but it does not reveal why which is what I uncover later on in this analysis. Overall, the differences between each racial group and their extroversion score was only around 1.39 on a 20 point scale, which indicates that there is not a strong association or noticeable pattern that can indicate that there is correlation between extroversion and race.
